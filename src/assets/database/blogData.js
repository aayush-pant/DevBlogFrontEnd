                        "The word Wulong translates to black dragon. The proper pinyin is wūlóng (乌龙), but oolong (a haphazard transliteration) has become the most popular spelling in the West.",
                        "Wulong leaves are semi- oxidized.This means that during production, oxidation is initiated, controlled and halted at some point before the leaves are considered fully oxidized.This is why you will often hear wulong described as being in between green tea and black tea.However, as with many things in the world of tea, it is more complicated than this.",
                        "A distinct step in the processing of traditional wulong tea is the bruising step(also called rattling or shaking).The leaves are shaken, lightly rolled or tumbled until the edges bruise.This bruising causes cellular damage and initiates the oxidation process.Bruising as a processing step is an iterative process wherein the leaves are bruised and allowed to wither and oxidize slowly.",
                        "The process happens repeatedly until they have reached a desired level of oxidation.The leaves are then heated(fixed) to stop oxidation and are shaped and dried.Let’s take a look at each step in a little more detail, beginning with the harvest."

                        "When plucking leaves for wulong production, tea pickers wait until the buds on the tea plant have opened and thickened. Depending on the intended shape of the final product, pickers will pluck anywhere from three to five leaves at a time. The reason for plucking older, thicker leaves is that they are more likely to endure the intense kneading and shaping required by the wulong production process."

                "Withering": [
                    "Wulongs are typically withered in the sun or in diffused light under movable shades outdoors. Once the leaves are bruised, the withering process continues, often indoors. The withering process varies from producer to producer, but the goals of withering are the same: to prepare the leaves for further processing by making them flaccid. The withered leaves allow fragrance to develop."
